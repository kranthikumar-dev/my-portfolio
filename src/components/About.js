          Hello! I'm <strong>Kranthi Kumar</strong>, a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and Web3 technologies. 
          I specialize in building modern, scalable web applications and decentralized apps (DApps). 
          With a strong problem-solving mindset and a focus on delivering seamless user experiences, I thrive on creating solutions that address real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began with a strong foundation in problem-solving and client-facing roles, which I later transitioned into full-stack development. 
          Since then, Iâ€™ve been honing my skills in JavaScript, React, and Node.js, while also diving into the exciting world of blockchain and Ethereum development. 
          I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay on top of the latest trends in web development and blockchain space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech innovations, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code.
